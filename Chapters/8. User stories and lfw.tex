\section{User Stories and Low Fidelity Wireframes }

The proposed solution to make the "Tiaki Kiddos" mobile app, started the process by writing twenty user stories were randomly collected via different user groups. These stories tell what childcare providers, care givers and the parents need from the app, like help with signing up kids, making schedules, and talking to parents, etc. Then, ten low fidelity wireframes were made to show what parts of the app which will look like based on these stories. These drawings help designing how the app could work and make it easier for developers making the app to know what to do in the UI/UX context of the app design.

All such details are included as \emph{Apendix B} in the following document. Putting these stories and drawings in the report shows how the project plans to make an app that helps childcare providers do their jobs better and provide better service for all stakeholders who are in this mobile ecosystem.
