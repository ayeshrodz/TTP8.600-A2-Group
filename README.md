# Advanced Mobile and Wireless Technologies

This group project was formed as the assessment 2 of Advanced Mobile and Wireless Technology subject.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

The purpose of this project is to explore a specific mobile and/or wireless strategy within a particular context or industry.

In this assessment, you will be proposing and researching the development and implementation of a mobile application or wireless solution.

You are to select an organisation, industry or context of your choice and research a problem/challenge/need that can be met or fulfilled by incorporating a mobile or wireless strategy or technology as a novel solution.

> **Please note:** _You may undertake a project for your workplace; however, this project must not have any confidentialityissues, and you will need to show approval from your lecturer and employer to use it in this assessment_.

In general, you will need to get formal approval from your lecturer before commencement of your project. The possible scope for this assessment has been left wide to enable you to undertake a project that interests you or work on creating an artefact.

There are weekly group submissions for this assignment and an individual submission at the end.

## PART A | Teamwork - 30% (WEEKLY SUBMISSION)

Imagine your group is a project team pioneering this project. Using Design Thinking approach (Empathise – Define – Ideate – Prototype – Test) within an AGILE-SCRUM project management methodology, the project would be done as weekly in-class sprints. In a group of 4-5 students, you are to do the following:

### SPRINT 1 | Week 2 (Empathise) - The aim of this sprint is to gain an empathic of the problem you are trying to solve (1000 words).

- Research and select an organisation of your choice with a problem/challenge or need you would like to meet or solve.
- Provide a detailed background and analysis of your chosen company/industry/context (which should include thebusiness process of the organisation/context)
- Explain the business process of the organisation or industry.

### SPRINT 2 | Week 3 (Define) - The objective of this sprint is to define the problem you are trying to solve in detail (1000 words).

- Provide an overview of the core problem(s) your project is proffering a solution to.
- Describe and justify the mobile strategy applicable to the problem or business process of the organisation.
- Brainstorm and provide a detailed technical discussion of the requirements for the mobile and wireless solution you are proposing.

### SPRINT 3 | Week 4 (Ideate): In this sprint, you are to start generating ideas as you understand the needs of your users(1000 words).

- List and briefly describe your potential users or user groups of the solution.
- If possible, carry out a contextual inquiry or interview (2 – 3 people) with users/user groups to investigate the existing or legacy system in organisation or context you have chosen.
- Design at least 3 personas showing how they map to your proposed application or solution.

### SPRINT 4 | Week 5 (Prototype - I) - The objective in this sprint is to produce prototypes for your solution (500 words) (1000 words).

- Write at least 20 user stories or use cases to reflect the requirements for your solution. These user stories could be written in relation to the users or user groups you have identified.
- Following a detailed analysis of your user stories, produce ten (10) low fidelity wireframes at a high level (drawn on paper) relaying the requirements in the user stories you have written.

### SPRINT 5 | Week 6 (Prototype - II) - The objective in this sprint is to continue to produce prototypes for your solution (1000 words).

- From the low fidelity wireframes, design high-fidelity wireframes (at least 10 screens using apps like flinto.com or proto.io) for your application reflecting the requirements in your user stories.
- Using at 5 of the wireframes, describe or explain the user journey of a potential user/user group on the application or solution.

> **Please note:** _Sprints may not be marked weekly. If you do not receive formal feedback about your sprint before the commencement of the following sprint, please proceed with the subsequent sprint._

## PART B | Individual - 30% | Sunday Week 8

### SPRINT 6 | Week 8 (Test): this sprint provides you the opportunity to critique your solution as an individual

As an Individual, using scholarly literature, write a report on the following (1500 words):

- Critique your solution and evaluate its effectiveness against at least two alternative strategies or solutions in your chosen organisation, industry, or context (500 words).
- Using scholarly literature, discuss the future of mobile and wireless technology in your chosen industry/context and the impact (500 words)
- Lastly, discuss the following: what went well in your group, what didn’t go well and what would you do differently next time (500 words)
